# Blue Dot Agency

Module 1 Boot Camp Challenge Website

## Description

-This project was built for a marketing agency trying to better understand and deliver its services to a customer.

-We used HTML to format the website on the back-end in order to carry out task that'd best fit the customers user story!

-We also added CSS for the front-end to style the webpage to give a more user friendly application.

-This solves the problem of having the agency and customer not knowing how to approach one another.

-I learned that each language we use in tandem with one another is extremely important in how the website presents itself.

## Installation
